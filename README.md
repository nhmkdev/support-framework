support-framework
=================

An open source ImpactJS / Intel XDK based framework/toolset.

This is a hobby project to learn more about JavaScript, ImpactJS, and the Intel XDK. ImpactJS is a great way to learn about JavaScript and the basics of game development.

Note: ImpactJS (http://impactjs.com) is required.

Current Status: Warzone! (very messy)

Current Focus: More/Better Documentation (coming soon!)

Per Platform Functionality

| Platform | Status |
| -------- | ------ |
| Browser | Working |
| Intel XDK (emulator) | Working |
| iOS | Broken |
| Android | Broken |

(At this time the Intel XDK + ImpactJS do not appear to function correctly on iOS OR Android.)
